# Flipper Lab — Embedded Systems, Automation & Security Research

This repository is the central hub for my Flipper Zero research and engineering projects,
covering infrared (IR), RFID/NFC, Sub-GHz RF, GPIO hardware experiments, and automation workflows.

All work is conducted on hardware I own or environments where I have explicit authorization.
