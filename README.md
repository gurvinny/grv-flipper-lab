# Flipper Lab — Embedded Systems, Automation & Security Research

This repository serves as the central hub for my Flipper Zero research and engineering projects, covering infrared (IR), RF, GPIO hardware experimentation, and automation workflows.

Each project focuses on hands-on learning, protocol analysis, real-world system design, and repeatable documentation.

All work is performed exclusively on devices I own or environments where I have explicit authorization.
